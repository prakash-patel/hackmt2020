# Charity Toy Tracker 9000
Toys for Tots, Angle Tree, Holiday Heros, are all charities that help underprivileged kids have a
great Christmas with Toys and other more practical items (clothes, shoes, coats, etc.).

The software available to large scale organizations is often too expensive to purchase or much
too difficult to administer and deploy by the “small” charities. If a group wants to help less than
1,000 children. There are some older legacy systems that require physical paper forms (gasp).

Our software will be basic but have a few key features to enable smaller charities to assist in
these functions.

## Technologies
This is a Python Flask App that uses a bootstrap frontend and using Vue javascript framework.
We are using Sqlite as the backend.

## Installation
