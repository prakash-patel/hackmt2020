          <p>Toys for Tots, Angle Tree, Holiday Heros, are all charities that help underprivileged kids have a
          great Christmas with Toys and other more practical items (clothes, shoes, coats, etc.).</p>
          
          <p>The software available to large scale organizations is often too expensive to purchase or much
          too difficult to administer and deploy by the “small” charities. If a group wants to help less than
          1,000 children. There are some older legacy systems that require physical paper forms (gasp).
          Our software will be basic but have a few key features to enable smaller charities to assist in
          these functions
